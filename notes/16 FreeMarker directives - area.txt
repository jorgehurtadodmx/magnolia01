[16]FreeMarker directives - area

CMS area directive
Used to render an area
On author instance, the result is an area bar and end marker

To render an area we must work in the page template script (.ftl)
Something like:
[@cms.area name="main" /]
in the content we want to render. Then green stuff will appear in the website to allow the authors to modify it.

[17]Exercise: Create an area
We add 
    [@cms.area name="main" /]

to the script (.ftl) file in my-training-module/templates/pages
which now contains 

<!doctype html>
<html lang="${cmsfn.language()}">
  <head>
    [@cms.page /]
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    [@cms.area name="main" /]
  </body>
</html>

And then, we add the area in the .yaml (the page maker)
(last 3 lines)
title: my-homepage
templateScript: /my-training-module/templates/pages/my-homepage.ftl
renderType: freemarker
visible: true
areas:
  main:
    type: noComponent

Then we go to JCR --> home --> main
There we have the full structure of what we made in the files as content pages.
