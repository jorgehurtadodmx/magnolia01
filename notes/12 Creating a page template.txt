To create a page template first I locate the templates folder in the route my-training-module and then I create
the page template definition as YAML and a script as a FTL.
/templates/pages/-->
The YAML will have the following content:
my-homepage.yaml
title: my-homepage
templateScript: /my-training-module/templates/pages/my-homepage.ftl
renderType: freemarker
visible: true


For the ftl file:
my-homepage.ftl

<!doctype html>
<html lang="${cmsfn.language()}">
  <head>
    [@cms.page /]
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>


After these two files, and only after these two, we can create a new page called "home" with the template "my-homepage".
With this, we have a page with a template created from zero.
