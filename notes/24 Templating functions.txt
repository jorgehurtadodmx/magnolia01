[24]Templating functions perform tasks like creating links and navigating content where
arguments are passed to functions and get an object in return.

There are two main templating functiosn:
cmsfn: Navigates content and creates links

damfn: Provides assets like images


[25]Exercise: Make use of cmsfn to decode a property

1. Modify a simple text field to a rich text field.
For that we edit the banner dialog definition in:
/light-modules/my-training-module/dialogs/components

The title field is currently a simple text field.
so we replace it with:
$type: richTextField

With the result as:
label: Banner properties
form:
  properties:
    title:
      $type: richTextField
      label: Title
    image:
      label: Select image
      $type: linkField
      chooser:
        workbenchChooser:
          appName: dam-chooser

TO MAKE IT WORK, it's important to make some changes in the description or title of the page. Otherwise we won't see changes.

Now, let's fix those <p></p> and take them out with:
3. Use cmsfn to decode title property.

Edit the banner template script found under:

/light-modules/my-workshop-module/templates/components
using the pattern:
${cmsfn.decode(content).propertyName}
Using
   <h2>${cmsfn.decode(content).title}</h2>
instead whatever was before, to convert the title into html. Now, all looks good.
