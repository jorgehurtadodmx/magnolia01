[36]YAML and FTL includes

This one is a littel bit more confusing, see more in 
https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/product-docs/6.2/Developing/Reusing-configuration/YAML-inherit-and-include.html


[37]Exercise: Make use of includes
1. Use YAML include to reuse field for the dialogs.
We create a imageLinkField.yaml in

includes/dialogs/.yaml

that has:
label: Select image
$type: linkField
chooser:
  workbenchChooser:
    appName: dam-chooser


and we use the yaml on dialogs/components  with the following:

label: Banner properties
form:
  properties:
    title:
      $type: richTextField
      i18n: true
   # image:
    #  label: Select image
    #  $type: linkField
    #  chooser:
    #    workbenchChooser:
    #      appName: dam-chooser

     image: !include:/my-training-module/includes/dialogs/imageLinkField.yaml
