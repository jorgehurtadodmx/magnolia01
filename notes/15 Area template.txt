Area template or component container defines the structure of a page and its components (0,1,n components)
Area template is a part of pages and other components

Area definition controls the page structure and provide repeatability.
Loops tru components rendering those one by one.
Areas definition are defined in page definition
page definition --> area definition
We can define the amount of components that editors can add in an area.

We use the property "areas" in the pages .yaml file and we provide a name with it.
We also can specify the components with tags like "availableComponents".
All the configuration must be correctly indented or it will all explode.
