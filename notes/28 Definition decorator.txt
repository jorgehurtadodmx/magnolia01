[28] Definition decorator
https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/product-docs/6.2/Developing/Definition-decoration.html
Magnolia mechanism taht allwos altering of existing configured items like app descriptors, dialogs, fields and templates coming
from either JCR or YAML from local system.
Decorations can only be defined in a YAML atm.

The route of decorators must be somethhing like
/decorations/dialogs/pages/home.yaml (basically, a yaml inside a decorations folder inside a module.

magnolia01\light-modules\my-training-module\decorations\pages-app\apps (final path + .yaml)
In my case, inside decorations folder I create folders page-app and apps inside this one.
Inside the last one, pages-app.yaml
we add this inside:
label: Home

We log out, log in and check that pages label is now called "Home"

[29]Exercise: Decorate an app label
Just do the same at [28] and we will manage to change the label of an app. Important to make the folders with the same names
and follow the instructions or it won't work
