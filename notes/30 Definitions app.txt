[32] Exercise: Add third content language

1. Add a third locale into the i18n configuration.

We go to Site or site definitions and navigate to
/i18n/locales
We duplicate the "de" node

We rename the duplicate to "fr" and save changes (set language value to fr of course)

We go to ur Home page and we can find at the bottom the language, we can find the new one.
