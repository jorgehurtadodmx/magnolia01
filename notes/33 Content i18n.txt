[33] 2 types of i18n
System and Content:
https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/product-docs/6.2/Administration/Language/Language-configuration.html
Content: Enables authors to enter content in different languages that are configured (language in which content is served)

I order to enable multi-language content:
We have to enable multi-language authoring
Set i18n property to true in field definition
Define locales in site --> site definitions --> i18 --> locales



This can be done in the configuration app under server  --> i18n --> authoring (set to true)
we add
      i18n: true
in the dialogs component definition as a property of key/value


We go to a page properties of a page that we have and we can find that we can switch between languges and see that 
some parts of the properties may switch to that language to fill

[34]Exercise: Content i18n and Internationalize banner content

Modify the banner definition adding the i18n to true, ending it like this:
label: Banner properties
form:
  properties:
    title:
      $type: richTextField
      label: Title
      i18n: true
    image:
      label: Select image
      $type: linkField
      chooser:
        workbenchChooser:
          appName: dam-chooser

Then we edit the specific parts on the home page changing the languages.
