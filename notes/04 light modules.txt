Light Modules are a prerequisite for creating pages and components
Light Module is just a host for files and provides resources to magnolia
Comes with live reload system (no refresh or restarts needed) to see changes. 


If we want to change the path of the Light Module route, we just go to 
\apache-tomcat\webapps\magnoliaAuthor\WEB-INF\config\default\magnolia.properties
And we find the Key/value:
magnolia.resources.dir=Route
