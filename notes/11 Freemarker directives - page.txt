We have 3 marker directives to use in Magnolia
CMS page directive is used to initialize a page for the editor and enables de author to edit the page.

Without this, the author cannot edit the page, so in order to enable this, we add in the page template script (a .ftl)
the cms page directive within the head element


 [@cms.page /]

Once this is placed, an author can start editing.
