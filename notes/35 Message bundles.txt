[36] Exercise: Render different copyright footer for different languages

1. Render different copyright footer in your page with help of message bundle.

In the i18n folder, we create files like
messages_en.properties

messages_de.properties

adding:
my.footer = My English Footer
and

my.footer = My German Footer
Now, we put in the page template script the rendering areas of what we want translated.

[37] System i18n
https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/product-docs/6.2/Administration/Language/Language-configuration.html

System i18n enables users to use the system in his preferred language
One of the languages is always a fallback languge

This allows the current logged user to select a language he wants in his profile (edit profile --> preferences --> language)


[38] Exercise: Change label to be set inside message bundle not in dialog definition

1. Change title to be set inside message bundle not in dialog definition.

Remove the label property from the banner dialog definition and save.

Quickly switch to your author instance and in the Pages app.

Open and edit the banner component that you have in the page.
This way you will see what the key is for the label you need to use in the messaging bundle.

This way we change labels information while using i18n (see git for more)
